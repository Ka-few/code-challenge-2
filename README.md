Event Guest List Manager
This a web application that aids a user to handle guests to a partiular event.
It accepts user input by allowing the user to type in the name of the guest, and categorizing the guest as either Family, Friend or colleague by clicking on the radio button options.
The guest data is then saved on the browser and displayed as list on the same window. 
The user is then equiped with more functionality and can toggle if the guest is either attending or not attending.
The user can also edit an individual guest's details and also can remove the guest from the list
The application also has a delete functionality that requires the user to enter the guest name that they intend to delete from the guest list.

To run the application open the index.html on any browser and you are good to go
